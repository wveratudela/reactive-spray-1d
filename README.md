# Reactive 1D Spray Column with Chemical Kinetics

## Overview

This project implements a custom 1D reactive spray column model coupling droplet evaporation with gas-phase chemical kinetics using Cantera.

The model solves coupled mass, species, and energy balances along a one-dimensional domain to study evaporation–reaction interactions and thermal behavior.

This is an original implementation intended as a minimal, transparent research model.
